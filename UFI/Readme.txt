UFI: Unreasonably Few Items

By: UFIOES

To install, extract UFI into \Steam\SteamApps\common\TUG\Mods\
Then add "Mods/UFI" to \Steam\SteamApps\common\TUG\Config\mods.txt
e.g.

Mods
{
	"Mods/UFI"
	"Game/Dev"
	"Game/Survival"
	"Game/Creative"
	"Game/Core"
}

I would like to thank:
	JohnyCilohokla: for assistance with coding and debugging.
	NerdKingdom: for TUG.
